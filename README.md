# Sleeper Tools

A Laravel-based toolkit for analyzing Sleeper fantasy football leagues with advanced statistics and insights.

## Overview

Sleeper Tools is a web application that provides comprehensive analysis tools for Sleeper fantasy football leagues. Built with Laravel 12 and modern PHP practices, it offers data-driven insights to help fantasy players understand their league dynamics, evaluate team performance, and make strategic decisions.

## Current Tools

### Shoulda Coulda Woulda Analysis

An advanced fantasy football analysis tool that calculates alternative win/loss records and strength of schedule metrics for your Sleeper league.

**What it does:**
- Calculates how each team would perform if they played every other team's schedule
- Analyzes head-to-head matchups between all teams
- Ranks teams by strength of schedule (toughest to easiest opponents)
- Identifies luck factors in current standings

**Key Features:**
- Interactive team cards showing actual vs. alternative records
- Strength of schedule visualization with progress bars
- Head-to-head breakdown for every team combination
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile viewing

```bash
composer install
```

3. Install Node.js dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

4. Copy environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

5. Generate application key:
```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

6. Build assets:
```bash
npm run build
```

### Using Laravel Sail (Docker)

If you prefer using Docker:

```bash
# Start the containers
./vendor/bin/sail up -d

# Install dependencies

./vendor/bin/sail npm install

# Generate key and build assets
./vendor/bin/sail artisan key:generate
./vendor/bin/sail npm run build
```

## Usage

### Shoulda Coulda Woulda Analysis

1. Navigate to the application in your browser
2. Enter your Sleeper League ID (found in your league URL)
3. Click "Analyze League" to generate comprehensive statistics
4. Explore team cards and strength of schedule rankings

### Performance Awards

1. From the dashboard, click "Performance Awards"
2. Select the week you want to analyze (defaults to most recent completed week)
3. View all weekly awards with detailed player information
4. Check the award tallies table to see cumulative season performance

### Finding Your League ID

Your Sleeper League ID is the numeric value in your league URL:
- Example: `https://sleeper.app/leagues/123456789/matchups`
- League ID: `123456789`

## Testing

The project uses Pest PHP for testing with comprehensive unit and feature test coverage.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
php artisan test

# Run with coverage
php artisan test --coverage

# Run specific test types
php artisan test --group=unit
php artisan test --group=feature

# Using Sail
./vendor/bin/sail artisan test
```

### Test Structure

- **Unit Tests**: Service layer logic, value objects, and DTOs
- **Feature Tests**: Controller integration and end-to-end workflows
- **Mock Data**: Realistic Sleeper API responses for consistent testing

## Architecture

### Service Layer Design

The application follows a service-oriented architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests and responses
- **Services**: Business logic and orchestration
- **Value Objects**: Type-safe data containers (LeagueId, Week, etc.)
- **DTOs**: Structured data transfer between layers
- **Interfaces**: Contracts for external API integration

### Key Services

- `ShouldaCouldaWouldaService`: Main analysis orchestration
- `PerformanceAwardsService`: Weekly award calculations and optimal lineup analysis
- `LeagueDataService`: Sleeper API data fetching and validation
- `ScheduleAnalysisService`: Matchup processing and schedule building
- `AlternativeRecordsService`: Core "what-if" calculation engine
- `StrengthOfScheduleService`: Opponent difficulty analysis

## API Integration

The application integrates with the Sleeper Fantasy API to fetch:
- League settings and metadata
- User profiles and roster information
- Weekly matchup results and scores
- Current NFL season state

All API interactions are abstracted through service contracts for testability and maintainability.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit issues, feature requests, or pull requests.

### Development Guidelines

- Follow PSR-12 coding standards
- Write tests for new features
- Use type hints and return types
- Document complex algorithms
- Maintain service layer separation
