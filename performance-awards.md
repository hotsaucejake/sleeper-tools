We have the "shoulda woulda coulda" tool.  Now I want to make a performance awards tool.  We should use our standards of services, value objects, DTOs, interfaces etc...

"The Ron Jeremy Performance Award" (RJPA) goes to the highest scoring player on a team for that week (not including the bench).

"The Money Shot" goes to the highest scoring team for that week.

Then we should have the following:

---
